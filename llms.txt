Core Laws Summary (ZCL v1.0 - The 10 Laws)
ZCL-01 (CTR Compression): Exponential decay of organic click-through rates as AI answers satisfy intent on the SERP.
ZCL-02 (Answer Primacy): User preference for immediate answers over exploratory search when AI provides sufficient confidence.
ZCL-03 (Source Hierarchy): Prioritization of verified entities (DOIs, Partner IDs) over unverified content in AI answer selection.
ZCL-04 (Schema Dependency): Direct correlation between structured data markup and AI answer inclusion probability.
ZCL-05 (Authority Entrenchment): Prioritization of static authorities (DOIs, Partner IDs, Wikidata) over dynamic content.
ZCL-06 (Citation Persistence): Once cited by AI models, entities experience sustained visibility through training data reinforcement.
ZCL-07 (Inference Control): Ability to bias AI search paths through strategic placement of high-authority "Answer Objects."
ZCL-08 (Verification Threshold): Exclusion of unverified sources once verified entities provide sufficient data density.
ZCL-09 (Entity Recognition): Wikidata and knowledge graph presence as prerequisite for consistent AI model citation.
ZCL-10 (Structural Compatibility): AI models favor content with semantic markup, proper heading hierarchy, and machine-readable formats.
