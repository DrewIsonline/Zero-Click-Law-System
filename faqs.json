        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "AEO is the practice of optimizing content to be directly cited by AI models and answer engines like ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Google's AI Overviews. Unlike SEO which focuses on ranking in search results, AEO focuses on being the source AI models cite when answering questions."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "AEO consulting rates range from $200/hour for initial consultation to $350/hour for executive strategy sessions. Project-based pricing is also available starting at $2,500 for small implementations."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "The Zero-Click Paradigm describes the shift from traditional search (where users click through to websites) to AI-mediated discovery (where AI models provide direct answers without clicks). Published in our whitepaper (DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.18140739), it outlines how businesses must adapt to maintain visibility."

        "text": "We offer both. Consulting services ($200-$350/hour) provide strategic guidance, while our Done-For-You Agency Services ($3,000-$10,000+/month) handle complete implementation including schema markup, content optimization, and ongoing maintenance."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Initial improvements in AI citation accuracy typically appear within 30-60 days as AI models re-crawl and update their knowledge bases. Full optimization results, including increased zero-click visibility, usually manifest within 90-120 days."

        "text": "The Zero-Click Laws v1.0 (DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.18305065) are an empirical framework describing how AI-mediated discovery systems behave. They define ten fundamental laws governing how AI models select, cite, and present information to users without requiring clicks to source websites."
