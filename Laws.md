## Abstract
[cite_start]This document introduces the **Zero-Click Laws**, a set of ten empirically testable propositions describing behavioral patterns in AI-mediated digital discovery[cite: 8]. [cite_start]As AI platforms increasingly resolve user queries without requiring navigation to external websites, traditional metrics of digital visibility have become inadequate[cite: 9]. [cite_start]This framework provides foundational metrics including the **CTR Compression Ratio (CCR)**, **Displacement Index (DI)**, and **Total Interaction Equity (TIE)** to diagnose visibility erosion[cite: 12].

## 🏛️ The Ten Zero-Click Laws

### ZCL-01: The CTR Compression Law
[cite_start]**If** impression volume is flat or rising for a defined page/query set, and answer-style surfaces (SERP features, AI answers) increase for that query class, **then** click-through rate compresses faster than impressions decline[cite: 45].
* **Measured by:** $CCR = CTR_{current} / CTR_{baseline}$. 
* [cite_start]**Trigger threshold:** $CCR \le 0.80$ sustained for 14+ days[cite: 46].

### ZCL-02: The Visibility Displacement Law
[cite_start]**If** impressions remain stable or rise but sessions decline over the same window, **then** visibility is being displaced—users see the brand but do not click[cite: 50].
* **Measured by:** $DI = (\Delta Sessions\% - \Delta Impressions\%)$. 
* [cite_start]**Trigger threshold:** $DI \le -15\%$ over a 28-day window[cite: 51].

### ZCL-03: The Efficiency Collapse Law
[cite_start]**If** impressions do not drop proportionally with sessions, **then** traffic-per-impression efficiency collapses before revenue clearly signals the damage[cite: 55].
* **Measured by:** $TIE = Sessions / Impressions$. 
* [cite_start]**Trigger threshold:** $TIE_{current} \le 0.85 \times TIE_{baseline}$ for 21+ days[cite: 56].

### ZCL-04: The Revenue Lag Law
[cite_start]**If** DI and CCR indicate displacement for multiple weeks, **then** revenue decline often lags traffic decline; the system creates a false sense of stability until conversion pools are exhausted[cite: 60, 61].
* [cite_start]**Measured by:** $DI \le -15\%$ for 28+ days while revenue remains stable, followed by decline[cite: 62].

### ZCL-05: The Non-Brand Fragility Law
[cite_start]**If** answer engines expand for non-brand discovery queries (how-to, comparisons), **then** non-brand traffic declines faster than brand traffic, even when total impressions appear stable[cite: 67].
* [cite_start]**Measured by:** $\Delta NonBrandSessions\% \le -15\%$ while $\Delta BrandSessions\% \ge -5\%$[cite: 69].

### ZCL-06: The Citation Paradox Law
[cite_start]**If** a brand is referenced or cited in AI answers but clicks still decline, **then** "being mentioned" does not equal "being visited"; citations can become a substitute for traffic[cite: 74, 75].
* [cite_start]**Measured by:** Evidence of citation combined with $CCR \le 0.80$ or $DI \le -15\%$[cite: 75].

### ZCL-07: The Intent Capture Law
[cite_start]**If** queries are primarily informational (definitions, summaries), **then** answer surfaces satisfy intent without visits; transactional queries retain relatively higher click need[cite: 79, 80].
* [cite_start]**Measured by:** Informational cohort $CCR \le 0.75$ while transactional cohort $CCR \ge 0.90$[cite: 81].

### ZCL-08: The Platform Gatekeeping Law
[cite_start]**If** a seller operates on a marketplace and AI summarization reduces outbound clicks, **then** the marketplace becomes the default conversion endpoint[cite: 85].
* [cite_start]**Measured by:** Off-platform organic sessions decline ($\le -15\%$) while marketplace views/sales remain stable[cite: 87].

### ZCL-09: The Compounding Displacement Law
[cite_start]**If** DI remains negative for consecutive measurement windows, **then** the impact compounds; recovery requires disproportionate effort versus initial loss[cite: 91, 92].
* [cite_start]**Measured by:** $DI \le -10\%$ for two consecutive 28-day windows[cite: 93].

### ZCL-10: The Benchmarkability Law
[cite_start]**If** metrics are normalized (CCR, TIE, DI) and segmented consistently, **then** displacement can be benchmarked across industries without requiring identical traffic volumes[cite: 97].
